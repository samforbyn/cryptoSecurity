Target Stores 2013 Data Breach

This data breach exposed ~ 110 million people's payment card info, as well as their contact info. Target had 
initially confirmed that credit and debit card info for ~ 40 million customers had been stolen. A handful
of weeks later Target confirmed that the email and mailing address for an additional 70 million people had been
exposed as well. Apparently the hackers broke into Target's network using login credentials stolen from an HVAC
company that works for several Target locations.

The hackers first gained access to Target's network on November 15, 2013 using a username and password stolen from Fazio 
Mechanical Services - a Pennsylvania based company specializing in providing refigeration and HVAC systems for 
Target and similar companies.

The hackers leveraged Fazio's access to Targets network, because Fazio had access rights to carry out tasks like
remotely monitoring energy consumption & temperatures. Using this leverage, the hackers were able to upload malware 
programs to the company's POS systems, undetected.

The motivations were most likely to steal peoples information and use while they had access to it. The "tech flaws"
weren't anything crazy, it was mainly that Target allowed a third party to access their networks without putting 
in any sort of checks and balances. They also didn't segment their network off for the third party, so by accessing the
network they had access to it's payment systems as well. Basically ignoring PCI Data Security Standards.

On top of spending $202 million for legal fees and other costs spanning across most of the US, they agreed to tighten
their digital security. Including maintaining software and encryption programs to safeguard their customers
personal information. They've apparanetly seperated their cardholder data from the rest of its network, as well as
pay for an independent assessment of their security measures.
